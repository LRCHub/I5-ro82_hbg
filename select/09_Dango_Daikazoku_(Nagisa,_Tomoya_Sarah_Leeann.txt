dango, dango, dango, dango
dango, my family
there is a stubborn roasted dango
and a gentle bean jam dango
if we could gather them together
we'd have a family
the baby dango smiles and is always
cradled in all its parents love
and the elder dango sits back
and muses over memories
what if everyone could see
that just by holding hands like the dango family
you will find love
now the little dango town is slowly blossoming
into the bright world i dream of
just beyond the starry sky
the rabbits on the moon wave and smiles down
upon the world below
roll up all the little things that make you sad
and find all the things that make you happy
