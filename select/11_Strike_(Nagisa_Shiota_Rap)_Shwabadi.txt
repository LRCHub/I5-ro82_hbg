Oh god, so unsuspecting, you'd never guess
I'm on 'em, been besting 'em and bashing heads
No fraud, I'm electing to forget their debts
I've got you all controlled worse than my mother did

Venemous strike when I sneak up on top of them
Sinking my fangs in before they expect
Letting them hide so when I come and find them
They cannot fight it and I put them to bed

I do not mind, let my animal side come alive
In the battle I'm climbing ahead
One against five are the odds that I like
Will you try not to cry when my blade's on your neck

Uh, you other chumps couldn't act this cool
I'll train to be a teacher, take you fuckers back to school
I'll show my feminine side and maybe once in a while
I'll dress up nice and surprise you with this viper's tool

Acing the test, it's no surprise that I'm beating the best
Got my gun aimed at the back of your head, kind of tempted to put you to bed
Looking at me like the role doesn't fit
Got the whole class right behind on my six
Fess up, I'm hoping you're scared out your wits
Mess with the cobra you're bound to get bit

Viper venom
Cobra bite

Strike

Oh god, from the shadows and I'm on ya
When this lowly little garter turns into an anaconda
You're a goner, 'bout to feel the grip come tightening stronger
I don't need the venom even when I'm biting like a mamba

I dress better, I'm known as a trend setter
I ain't ever met a dude that ain't fooled, I'm a brain bender
They're doomed to fall, veterans, losing their cool deading 'em
My enemies are easily confused, just like my gender

I'm an animal, stalking my prey like a lone cannibal
Flexing the bone mandibles, Enter the zone, now you fall
Never alone pack is support at my back, infallible
Sending your defenses up in smoke because they're flammable

Getting me stressed? Unlikely 'cause I ain't easily pressed
Don't know what's under my tactical vest, I put a rubber knife right in your chest
I'm answering the test as if I'm making a kill
My sensei was the best, eight big shoes to fill

Viper venom
Cobra bite
